"""Auth and per-client/per-route rate limiting for the voice gateway
(tasks t_ed297906, t_89295105).

``AuthMiddleware`` enforces the device-token contract of the ESP → gateway
protocol (ТЗ section 40, docs/protocol.md):

* clients present the token as ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` **or**
  ``X-Device-Token: <token>`` (docs/protocol.md — both forms are valid);
* missing/invalid tokens are answered ``401`` with
  ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="voice-gateway"`` and the stable
  machine code ``{"error": "unauthorized"}``;
* comparison is constant-time (``hmac.compare_digest`` over equal-length
  SHA-256 digests) so token length and prefix matches leak nothing;
* a correlation ID is generated for every request (reusing an incoming
  ``X-Correlation-Id`` when present), exposed via :data:`correlation_id_var`
  for structured logging, and echoed back in the response header;
* the test-only disable mode is an explicit :class:`SecurityConfig`
  decision (``auth_enabled=False``), never an accident of a missing env
  var (the token is protective inside a trusted LAN, not a security
  boundary, and must never be logged or archived);
* on success, the presented token is published as
  ``scope["state"]["rate_limit_client_id"]`` — the device-keyed identity
  ``RateLimitMiddleware`` prefers over a raw IP (see its docstring).

``RateLimiter`` keeps two independent in-memory sliding windows:

* one per ``(client, route)`` pair (client = device token / IP — see
  :func:`_client_id`), so a client's traffic on one route never exhausts
  its allowance on another;
* one per route (matched FastAPI route template — see
  :func:`_route_template`), so one client cannot starve a shared route.

both bounded by ``SecurityConfig.rate_limit`` requests per
``SecurityConfig.rate_period`` seconds. ``check()`` answers ``"ok"`` /
``"client"`` / ``"route"``.

``RateLimitMiddleware`` wires the limiter onto the ASGI stack: rejected
requests get ``429`` + ``Retry-After`` header (RFC 6585) and never reach
the endpoint. The backing limiter is reachable via the middleware's
``limiter`` property for tests and inspection.

Single-process only: window state lives in process memory, so with
multiple worker processes each enforces the limit independently and the
aggregate allowance becomes ``workers x rate_limit``. For multi-worker
deployments use a shared backend (e.g. Redis) or run a single worker.

Client identity (``_client_id``), in priority order:

1. ``scope["state"]["rate_limit_client_id"]`` — set by ``AuthMiddleware``
   once a request is authenticated (see above);
2. the first ``X-Forwarded-For`` hop (behind a trusted reverse proxy);
3. the peer address (``scope["client"]``);
4. ``"unknown"`` (tests / unresolvable transport).

Public ops/monitoring paths (health, metrics, docs) are exempt from both
auth and rate limiting — they must stay reachable for probes no matter
what the traffic looks like.

Both middlewares are written as pure ASGI classes (``__call__(self, scope,
receive, send)``), not ``@app.middleware("http")`` / ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``
subclasses. ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` buffers the request body through an
internal memory stream, which breaks a client disconnect propagating to
an endpoint that reads ``request.stream()`` directly -- exactly what the
voice-turn endpoint does (this broke ``test_turn_metadata_on_disconnect``
twice already: once when ``RequestMetricsMiddleware`` used it, and again
when this file's first version, ``RateLimitMiddleware``, did). Any
middleware in the chain ahead of the streaming endpoint must be pure ASGI,
not just the one that happens to touch the body.
